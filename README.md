# Cypress Setup

Using Angular CLI, it is slick and easy to start a new Angular project with the `ng new` command. To install the latest version of of Angular CLI, run the following command. This will install Angular CLI globally onto your system. If you don't have NPM installed, [download and install nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

You can call you're project whatever you want, but I'll be using `angular-cypress` for this tutorial. Run the following command to create your new project:
